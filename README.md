Nexcare is heart disease prediction webapp that consist of different model training to predict the heart disease . For that we use different feature classification on basis of given data which we taken from Kaggle .

The dataset contains patient information, including:

Age
Gender
Blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Results of various medical tests
The data is preprocessed and analyzed using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

Model Description
We implemented several machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Neural Networks
Feature engineering and selection techniques were applied to identify the most informative attributes for each model.

Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Cross-validation is employed to ensure robustness and generalizability.

Results
Our machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy in detecting heart disease. Detailed results and performance metrics for each model are provided in the results/ directory.
